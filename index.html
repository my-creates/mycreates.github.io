        <p>Hi, my name is Maya and I am starting a new venture during this time where everything is changing for me.
            I am 24 and I feel stuck in a dead end at a job that feels like the people are not appreciative of the 
            work being done. You are handed extra responsibilty but no extra pay. 
        </p>
        <p>So, I wanted to match two of my hobbies together to start off. Right now, I am really into crochet and with 
            the closing of Joann's Fabrics has left me really sad. I have been stocking as much as I can but it will 
            always be a bit of a void since it's gone. I mean, I still Michael's but Joann's was closer to my current job.
            So, it's bittersweet.
        </p>
