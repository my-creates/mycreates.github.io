    <h2>Here's the Corner</h2>
    <h3>Welcome to the Creative Side</h3>

    <p>Hi, my name is Maya. I am 24 years old and this my personal website. This is mainly for all my hobbies to
        showcase my talents. Even this website is to showcase my talents. I just want to showcase my certifications
        and things I have been doing to practice my skills.
    </p>
    <h3>Certifications</h3>
    <h5>UX Design Specialization</h5>
    <p>Took this to get a clean understanding of UI design Principles, here are some pics below:</p>

    <!--found from shecodes.io-->

    <p>So, these are just some things that I have made recently but I decided to showcase them here. I am 
        currently stuck, in what feels like a dead end. Like I said on the main page, I am trying to 
        combine my two main hobbies. Honestly, these two things are keeping me sane. I am hoping that things
        would lead to somewhere such as a career. I am honestly ready to leave the automotive industry and I am
        hoping to break into something that follows my degree. 
    </p>
    <p>Speaking of my degree, I graduated from Columbia College Chicago in May of 2023. I received my Bachelor's 
        Degree in Game Art but I found a love of programming while there. I took a lot of classes that followed 
        may different languages such as C#, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I still take a lot of care and I am
        very proud of my drawings but I started getting into different means of self expression through other creative
        prowesses. Creating things brings me a lot of joy and this shows my main personality without having to actually
        talk.
